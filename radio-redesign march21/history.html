            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                In the late 1990’s a group of students started investigating the process of starting a 
                college radio station. The group was formally recognized through Lewis-Clark State College 
                Student Activities as “The Radio.” These individuals conducted regular meetings and
                 fundraisers to save enough money to make their dream a reality. In the fall of 2002 the
                  ASLCSC assisted the radio station through financial contributions for equipment. The
                   Student Union Building Board also authorized the dedication of room SUB 205 to be used
                    to house a radio station. Discussions began in 2002 by the ASLCSC Student Body President
                     and Lewiston High School regarding sharing the high school’s station KLHS 88.9 FM.
            </p>
            <p>
                    In time, it was decided that Lewis-Clark State College would have greater involvement and 
                    ultimately be a better fit for the 88.9 FM frequencies. The Radio Club then purchased the 
                    license and the older equipment from Lewiston High School. It was recognized that the 
                    equipment was quite antiquated and new equipment was needed. Mike Ripley and the Idaho 
                    State Broadcasters Association saw the station’s need and offered to help by loaning the 
                    Radio Club funds to purchase a new transmitter and antenna. This loan agreement stated 
                    that the Radio Club would need to pay back half the loan over the course of 5 years and 
                    if the station was successful in staying on the air over these five years, the remainder 
                    of the loan would be a gift from the ISBA.
            </p>
            <p>
                    After working with field engineers and an FCC attorney over the course of a year the 
                    transmitter and antenna were relocated to the LCSC Natural Science Building. The 
                    station had a deadline by the FCC of when it had to be relocated and back on the 
                    air and in October of 2006 the station was turned on for the first time at its new 
                    location, just in time. A couple months after the new station was on the air, new call
                     letters were established and the station is now known as, “KLCZ 88.9FM Lewiston!”
